Creating a command-line To-Do List application in Rust is a great project to enhance your understanding of the language, especially in terms of data structures, error handling, and file I/O. Here are some key aspects and features you might consider while developing this application:

### 1. **Basic Features**
   - **Add Task**: Allow users to input a task description and add it to the list.
   - **Remove Task**: Enable users to remove a task by specifying its index or description.
   - **View Tasks**: Display the current list of tasks, including their indices for easy reference.

### 2. **Data Structures**
   - Use a vector (`Vec<String>`) to store tasks in memory. This allows for dynamic resizing and easy manipulation of the list.
   - Consider creating a struct to represent a task, which could include fields like `description`, `is_completed`, and `created_at` for more advanced features.

### 3. **File I/O**
   - Implement functionality to read tasks from a file when the application starts. This could be a simple text file where each line represents a task.
   - When tasks are added or removed, update the file accordingly to ensure persistence between runs.
   - Handle potential errors in file operations, such as file not found or permission issues.

### 4. **Error Handling**
   - Use Rust's `Result` and `Option` types to handle errors gracefully. For example, when trying to remove a task that doesn't exist, return an appropriate error message.
   - Validate user input to ensure that it meets expected formats (e.g., checking if a task index is a valid number).

### 5. **User Interface**
   - Create a simple text-based menu that allows users to choose actions (add, remove, view, exit).
   - Provide clear prompts and feedback for user actions, such as confirming when a task is added or removed.

### 6. **Advanced Features (Optional)**
   - **Task Completion**: Allow users to mark tasks as completed and filter the view to show only pending or completed tasks.
   - **Due Dates**: Add functionality to set due dates for tasks and sort tasks based on their due dates.
   - **Categories**: Implement categories or tags for tasks to help users organize them better.
   - **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for tasks based on keywords in their descriptions.

### 7. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected. This is particularly important for file I/O operations and task management functions.

### 8. **Documentation**
   - Document your code and provide a README file that explains how to install and use the application. This is a good practice for any software project.

### 9. **Learning Resources**
   - Familiarize yourself with Rust's standard library, especially modules related to collections, file I/O, and error handling.
   - Explore Rust's ownership model and how it affects data management in your application.

By focusing on these aspects, you'll not only create a functional To-Do List application but also gain valuable experience in Rust programming.
